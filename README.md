This repository contains over 220 [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org) signature modules from the community, including
those heavily modified by Optiv for correctness, removal of false positives,
and more detailed information.  It also includes over 75 new signature modules
developed solely by Optiv and provided under the GPL.

Please note that many of these signature modules make use of Optiv's extensive
improvements to both Cuckoo and cuckoomon and are noted accordingly as requiring
Cuckoo version "1.2".

December 1st 2015 is my last day at Optiv.  I want to thank Optiv for giving me the opportunity to contribute all this work to the rest of the world.
Since I will no longer have access to this account, I have created a fork of each of the repos at https://github.com/spender-sandbox/ which you may
submit pull requests to that I will respond to quickly.

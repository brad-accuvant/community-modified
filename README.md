This repository contains over 220 [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org) signature modules from the community, including
those heavily modified for correctness, removal of false positives,
and more detailed information.  It also includes over 75 new signature modules provided under the GPL.

Please note that many of these signature modules make use of extensive
improvements to both Cuckoo and cuckoomon and are noted accordingly as requiring
Cuckoo version "1.2".

Since I will no longer have access to this account, I have created a fork of each of the repos at https://github.com/spender-sandbox/ which you may
submit pull requests to that I will respond to quickly.
